## Let's play with emojitracker!  

This is **EASILY** the dumbest thing I've coded to date, but it's *mildely* entertaining.  It flashes patterns accross [emojitracker.com](http://emojitracker.com) by first scraping the current rankings grid, and then tweeting the relevant emojies in patterns accross a pre-defined matrix.  

Additionally it saves the emoji rankings in a json file for future highly technichal and monumentally earthshattering analysis.  Undoubtedly the keys to predicting the stockmarket **AND** global warming are contained within those little yellow replacements for human contact, and their relative frequency on twitter. Time to nerd out hard boys and girls!  

To set up/run:  
1. Put your relevant api info in the correct params in a call to setup() and then run the notebook.  
2. Give [Mroth](https://github.com/mroth) a high five if you know him because his code is dope!
